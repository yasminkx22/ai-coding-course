Prompt: "Create a decision-making program = Study method selector (asks about subject, time available, learning style). Ask the user at least 3 questions
Use their answers to give a recommendation or result
Include at least one if, one elif, and one else. Add more options to this if/elif chain
Add comments explaining the logic
Each function should do ONE clear thing
Function names should describe what they do
Use return values to pass information between functions
The main part of your program should be easy to read"

I was surprised that this time the program was way shorter and more easier to read because i asked AI to do so.

Answering:
1.What does your program decide?
2.What's one interesting if/elif/else you used?
3.What AI prompt helped you most?

1.The program suggests a specific study method (like the Pomodoro Technique, Mind Mapping, or the Feynman Technique) based on three variables: the subject matter, the user's available time, and their preferred learning style.
2.Probably this elif is interesting because it requires two conditions to be true (a specific subject and time):
elif subject in ["math", "science", "physics"] and time >= 60: return "The Feynman Technique: Try to explain a concept on a whiteboard as if to a child."
3.The one at the end when I asked to explain the code.

## 2
Prompt 1: Build a Countdown timer (counts down from 10) that repeats a specific number of times using for loops
Prompt 2: Build a Number guessing game (keep guessing until correct) that repeats until a condition is met using while loops

Short reflection:
1.When is a for loop better than a while loop?
2.What's one bug you ran into and how did you fix it?

1.I think for loops are used when you already know the plan. For instance, if you need to count down from 10 or print something exactly 5 times. While loops are used when things are unpredictable. For example, "keep asking for a password until they actually get it right." 
2.I didn't encounter any bugs.

Mr. Herzetaly, I apologize for not submitting the third program. I wasn't feeling very well yesterday, so I wasn't able to finish the final piece of homework in time.
I to completed the first two programs this morning. I will submit the missing program along with my next homework assignment.
