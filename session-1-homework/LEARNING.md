# Homework experience and reflection
Personally, I've found Gemini to be more effective for my work than ChatGPT. Gemini provides much clearer results and more descriptive explanation, while also including informative reference information for further use. Consequently, I’ve decided to continue my work using Gemini.
## 1. greeting.py
I began by describing to Gemini the Python program I wanted it to write. I really like the part where it describes everything in the code that lets me understand what everything in the code means in order to fully immerse myself into understanding the work.
While doing this program, I learned about the reset thing, which is "\033[0m" for the colours so the terminal doesn't stay colorful forever. The AI suggested using the “import time”  module to add some real conversation experience as a way to make it extraordinary, so it doesn't feel like a cold, instant machine. I also asked it to add some emojis for variety.
I decided to make my program into two acts:
1. Casual Small Talk
2. Imaginative Exploration
Ultimately, I learned many new variables and modules in Python during this part of the homework, such as import time, feedback functions, .strip(), etc. 
In addition, I wanted to add a feature in the second act to identify only the noun if the person writes a whole sentence. However, for that, I would need a specific library installed on my computer and on the computer of the person reading it. So, I decided not to add it for now.
## 2. calculator.py
For the calculator program, I asked Gemini to create a variety of operations. This code was easy for me to understand and implement. Basically, I didn’t have any difficulties with this program.
## 3. guessing_game.py 
By the 3rd program, I had gotten the hang of it. I completed it quite easily and learned new Python modes and functions.
### Conclusion
I enjoyed studying with Gemini - discussing the code, having it explain everything, and making it sound easier and more understandable when I asked.
Also, I have reviewed each program's code and made my own adjustments for the final work.
