# Homework experience and reflection
## 1 
Prompt: 
"Build a python program that asks you 5-10 questions about your current life and saves the answers to a beautifully formatted text file called time_capsule_2026.txt.
With at least 5 different questions (current favorite song, biggest goal, best friend's name, etc.)
Use f-strings to format the output nicely
Save to a file with clear sections and borders
Add the today's date at the top 
Add a line that says "To be opened in: [future date]"
And then I also prompted the output example. 
## 2
Prompt:
"Create a simple calculator on python that:
Asks for two numbers
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Displays all results
Saves the calculation history to a file called calculator_history.txt
Requirements:
Get two numbers from the user
Calculate all four operations
Print results in a nice format
Append (not overwrite!) each calculation to the history file with a timestamp
Example saved format:
[Feb 2, 2026 - 3:45 PM]
15 + 7 = 22
15 - 7 = 8
15 × 7 = 105
15 ÷ 7 = 2.14"
Calculator with Memory was pretty easy. Additionally, I asked AI to add the ":.2f" numbers' formatting to show only 2 decimal places.
## 3
Prompt: 
"Music Playlist Manager in python
Collect song names and artists
Store in a list
Save the playlist to a formatted text file
Number the songs, add a playlist title and creation date. 
Use at least one list OR one dictionary
Save to a well-formatted file
Add one creative feature from your mind"
### Conclusion
For all of my prompts Gemini replied with almost exactly what I wanted. The borders were just a little off all the time, that I had to fix myself. As well as, I changed the code according to what I wanted to be in the text. Afterwards I spend some time understanding the codes.
